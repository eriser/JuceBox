JuceBox
=======

JuceBox is a rudimentary sample-player plugin built on Juce.  It's probably
most useful as an example program, although actually using it can be fun
depending on what sample you use (a good orchestral strings sample, eg.
Sonatina 1st Violins, can be surprisingly satisfying).  Currently, you can't
even tell it what note the sample file was sampled for; it assumes C5.
